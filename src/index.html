			<h1>COVID-19 SIMULATIOR</h1>
			<p>
				The simulations on this page was created as a final assignment in the
				course IR201812 - Statistics and simulation @ NTNU Ålesund. The main
				task was to reproduce the four scenarios modelled in
				<a
					href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/"
					class="href"
				>
					washington Post - corona simulator
				</a>
				. The assignment also had additional parameters and scenarios which had
				to be implemented and analyzed,
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Some rules for the assignment:</b>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Agent based simulation.</li>
				<li>
					Free mobility scenario has to have an infection probability of 2.5
				</li>
				<li>200 persons for first experiments.</li>
				<li>Must include scenarios:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Free for all - Every person can move freely.</li>
					<li>
						Forced Quarantine - A portion of persons are loced up for a period
						where one is infected, before the "sluce" is opened graduadly.
					</li>
					<li>
						One quarater - One quartar of the population is allowed to move
						freely, the rest is in quarantine.
					</li>
					<li>
						One in eight - Only every eight person is allowed to move freely,
						the rest is in quarantine.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Probability of people dying.</li>
				<li>
					Scale to 100.000 persons and the area proportionaly and analyze the
					difference of infected, recovered and dead people.
				</li>
				<li>The effects of age (mortality as a function of age).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The simulator was written from scratch usning JavaScript (TypeScript),
				P5js for drawing, and Chart.js for charts. Code is available on GitHub
